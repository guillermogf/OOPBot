OOPBot is a Object Oriented Programmed Telegram Bot.

It is made to ease the process of creating a new Bot, allowing different
bots to share basic code and have configurable bots which don't take up much
resources.

Creating a bot is as easy as writing the following lines into a script:

import Bot
your_bot = Bot.Bot("your_bot", "/path/to/config/file")
your_bot.setTextCommands([list_with_commands, list_with_texts])
your_bot.setCommands([list_with_commands, list_with_functions])
your_bot.start()
